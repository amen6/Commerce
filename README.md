# Commerce
I designed an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a *â€œwatchlist"*.
First, you need to login or the only thing you will be able to do is looking at from homepage
<img src="Images/No-Login.png" alt="Guest View"/>
After you login, your homepage will look like this <img src="Images/Homepage.png" alt="User Hompage"/>
By clicking on *Crate Listing* you will be taken to a page where you are able to create an auction list,
<img src="Images/Create.png" alt="Create auction page"/>
I used **forms.ModelForm** for this page, you need to implement a (title, description, the starting bid, select a category, and it's optional to provide a URL for an image to use in your auction list).
Also if you want to check a list you can just click on its title and you will be redirected to that auction list page,
<img src="Images/Client-List.png" alt="Auction list page"/>
You can see the image if available, the title and description too, and by clicking on *ADD/REMOVE-> WATCHLIST* you will add this auction to your watchlist where you can access it by clicking on *Watchlist* button on the top, and by clicking on the category which is *Toy* here, you will get redirected to page that shows you all auctions lists with the same category, in the bid box a bid less than the starting bid or the current bid if available won't be acceptable, and you can insert a comment in the comment box and the comment will appear at the bottom with the username too.
The list creator have more access like *Delete List* and *Close List* as we can see here
<img src="Images/Maker-List.png" alt="Auction list page"/>
*Delete List* will delete the auction list permanently and *Close List* will close comments and bids and the bigger bid will be considered as the winning bid.
